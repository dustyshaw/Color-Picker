            Color theory is the study of how colors interact and how they can be combined in various ways to create
            aesthetically pleasing and visually impactful compositions. It provides a systematic framework for artists,
            designers, and anyone working with colors to make informed decisions about color choices and combinations.
        </p>

        <p> At its core, color theory is built upon the color wheel, a circular representation of the primary,
            secondary, and tertiary colors. The primary colors—red, blue, and yellow—are fundamental hues that cannot be
            created by mixing other colors together. Secondary colors—green, orange, and purple—are obtained by mixing
            two primary colors in equal proportions. Tertiary colors are the result of mixing a primary color with a
            neighboring secondary color.</p>

        <h2>Color theory delves into several key concepts:</h2>

        <h5>1. Color Harmony:</h5>
        <p>Color harmony refers to the arrangement of colors in a way that is visually pleasing.
            Different color combinations can evoke varying emotions and moods. Complementary colors, situated opposite
            each other on the color wheel (e.g., red and green), create a high-contrast, vibrant effect. Analogous
            colors, which are adjacent to each other (e.g., blue and green), provide a more harmonious and soothing
            appearance.</p>

        <h5>2. Color Schemes:</h5>
        <p>Color schemes are predefined combinations of colors that work well together. Some
            common color schemes include monochromatic (variations of a single color), analogous (adjacent colors),
            triadic (three equidistant colors on the color wheel), and split-complementary (a base color with two
            adjacent to its complementary).</p>

        <h5>3. Color Value:</h5>
        <p>Value refers to the lightness or darkness of a color. Adding black to a color results in
            a darker shade, while adding white creates a lighter tint. Manipulating value can add depth and dimension to
            an artwork or design.</p>

        <h5>4. Color Temperature:</h5>
        <p>Colors are often described as warm or cool. Warm colors like red, orange, and
            yellow evoke feelings of energy and warmth, while cool colors like blue, green, and purple create a sense of
            calmness and tranquility. Understanding color temperature can be crucial for conveying specific emotions.
        </p>

        <h5>5. Color Context:</h5>
        <p>The way we perceive a color can be influenced by the colors surrounding it. The same
            color can appear different when placed against contrasting backgrounds. This phenomenon is known as
            simultaneous contrast and is an essential consideration in color composition.</p>

        <h5>6. Psychological Impact:</h5>
        <p>Different colors can evoke psychological responses. For example, red might
            symbolize passion or danger, while blue might evoke feelings of trust and stability. These associations can
            vary across cultures, but understanding the psychological impact of colors can enhance communication through
            visuals.</p>

        <p>By applying the principles of color theory, artists and designers can create visually appealing and
            effective compositions that communicate their intended messages and emotions. Whether it's painting, graphic
            design, interior decorating, or any other creative endeavor involving colors, a solid grasp of color theory
            is invaluable in achieving compelling and impactful results.</p>
